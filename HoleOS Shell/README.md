The latest version of HoleOS Shell (1.2).

# About HoleOS Shell

HoleOS Shell is the default GNOME Shell Theme of HoleOS. In HoleOSalpha2, it included a login screen but in HoleOSalpha, it got replaced with LightDM's default login screen
theme by the new version (1.2). 1.1 was a full GNOME Shell Theme, but 1.2 is just a User Theme.

# Availability

HoleOS Shell runs perfectly on HoleOS, but it can be runned on other distros as well such as Ubuntu or Fedora. It is not a complete GNOME Shell Theme, so **DO NOT** replace your
shell theme with HoleOS Shell 1.2, you need to install Gnome Tweaks, install User Theme extension for GT, and put HoleOS Shell to the folder */home/username/.themes/* .
